### Glossary

| SPECIALISED TERM | DEFINITION |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Conductivity, Temperature, Depth (CTD) sensor | Sensor used to measure temperature, conductivity and pressure. Additional sensors are often attached to the frame of the deployable CTD frame (oxygen, chlorophyll, pH, etc.) to collect additional data. Often, Niskin bottles are attached to the same deployable metal frame as the CTD and ancilliary sensors so that water parameter data are collected alongside Niskin water samples. Deployments of this suite of instruments and sensors on the same frame are often referred to as a "CTD cast". |
| Field blank | Sampling negative control. Typically distilled or reverse osmosis water run through a filter like an eDNA water sample to control for contamination in the field sampling step.  |
| Niskin bottle  | Plastic cylindrical bottle of varying volumes for collecting discrete water samples. A stopper at each end of the bottle can be "cocked" open with an electronic or weight triggered release mechanism causing the stoppers to snap shut. This is remotely triggered, so the bottle closes at a prescribed depth. Often, multiple bottles are arranged on the same frame as a CTD and other sensors in a "rosette". |

## BACKGROUND

### Summary

Water collection and filtration protocol using [Smith-Root self preserving eDNA filters](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.13212) to collect environmental DNA from marine, freshwater and estuarine ecosystems. This collection and filtration protocol is used by the NOAA PMEL Ocean Molecular Ecology (OME) Group.

### Method Description and Rationale

This protocol describes the collection and filtration of water samples through a 0.22 µm sterile  disc filter in the Smith-Root self preserving eDNA filter housing to capture eDNA and DNA-containing particulates. The Smith-Root filter DNA will later be extracted from these samples for multi-locus metabarcoding and qPCR analysis. The protocol is intended for water collected with a Niskin bottle mounted on a ship-deployed CTD rosette sampler or ROV, but it can also be employed for samples collected by hand.

### Spatial Coverage and Environment(s) of Relevance

This protocol has been used to filter eDNA from hundreds of seawater samples taken from coastal stations off the western coast of North America in the Northeastern Pacific Ocean, Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean (primarily off California, Oregon, Washington, and Alaska) as well as from the freshwater Lake Washington. Samples collected range in depth from surface ocean (epipelagic biome) to just off bottom (benthic biome) at varying distances from shore (coastal to off-shelf).

### Personnel Required

One person with pipetting experience. Recommend research vessel experience, but not required.

### Safety

This protocol does not involve any hazardous chemicals, although standard precautions, including wearing PPE, should be taken to avoid skin and eye exposure to bleach and ethanol.

### Training Requirements

Molecular biology training (including, at a minimum, sterile technique and pipetting technique) is required to conduct this protocol. Experience with going to sea and sample collection under seagoing conditions is encouraged, at a minimum personel should be trained in the filtering protocol in a laboratory/docked ship setting beforehand.

### Time Required to Execute the Procedure

The time needed varies widely based on the number and type of samples collected. For a majority of our sampling, Niskin bottles on a CTD rosette and/or ROV are triggered to collect at three depths (e.g., surface, 30m, and 10m off bottom). Then pending the study design and Niskin size, a singular sample or triplicate samples are collected from each Niskin. The depth of collection and number of samples affect the time required - for instance, a cast to 30 m may take 10 minutes, while a cast to 600 m may take over an hour. Collecting samples from the Niskins take between 10-30 minutes, depending on access and whether the water is being used for other science. We've also collected samples using a bucket or by directly submerging bottles in sample water in situ, which takes significantly less time for collection.

The Smith-Root and peristaltic pump filtration set-up for three singular samples takes on average 10 minutes. Pending the turbidity of the water, the filtering of a single sample takes 5-20 minutes and repackaging of the filter takes 1-2 minutes. 

The total collection and filtering time for a singular cast with three Niskins triggered and one sample taken from each Niskin is 120 minutes (2 hours) on average. More casts, more samples = more time.

## STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE

### Preparation

**Glove Sterilization:**
When sterilizing any equipment or filtering, sterile nitrile gloves must be used. Gloves directly from the box are not considered sterile. To sterilize, squirt 10% bleach solution from a squirt bottle onto new pair of gloves and rub hands together, then squirt with EtOH to get rid of bleach residue. Nitrile gloves should be worn at all times during the sterilization, sampling, filtering, preservation, and storage steps.

**Bucket Sterilization:**

1. Create 10% bleach solution directly in bucket (4-6 L). Seal the lid carefully and shake for 2-3 minutes.
2. Empty the 10% bleach solution. Fill carboy with 3-4 L of RO water and shake for 1-2 minutes. Repeat this RO wash step two more times (= 3 rinses in total).
9. Once complete, close the bucket with a lid, label, and close with tape.

**Carboy Sterilization:**
Recommend completing before embarking onto the vessel, preferably back in the laboratory environment. Similar process can be completed with squirt bottles. **Only required if you are bringing a carboy of RO into the field.**

1. Create 10% bleach solution directly in a carboy (4-6 L). Close the carboy, make sure the spigot is closed, and shake for 2-3 minutes.
2. Empty the 10% bleach solution via the spigot into the sink. Allow 50-80% of the bleach solution to leave through the spigot, then dump the rest. You’ll need to loosen the cap a bit; otherwise, an airlock will prevent the flow. 
3. Fill carboy with 3-4 L of RO water and shake for 1-2 minutes. Repeat this RO wash step two more times (= 3 rinses in total).
4. Once complete, seal the carboy lid and spigot with parafilm. If using immediately, fill with RO water. Otherwise, this sealed, sterile carboy can be stored for month+.

**Bottle Sterilization:**
One sterile bottle is required for each sample and each field blank.

Bottle Sterilization Method (RO Available):

1. Create a 10% bleach solution in one of the buckets (6-10 L total, depending on needs).
2. Fill 4-6 bottles at a time with 10% bleach solution; fill to the top and seal with a lid. Allow to sit for 15 minutes.
3. Pour 10% bleach from these bottles into the next set of bottles or reuse bleach for further sterilization needs.
4. Each bottle needs to be rinsed with  RO three times. Fill each Nalgene bottle with ~200 mL of RO, and then shake for 30-45 seconds (3x total).
5. Shake out excess RO dumped (doesn’t need to be entirely dry), close it with the cap, and then wrap the top with parafilm to maintain sterility. Always wrap in the direction the cap tightens, so clockwise.

Bottle Sterilization Method with (RO Not Available):

1. Complete Steps 1-3 from Bottle Sterilization Method (RO Available).
2. Close it with the cap then wrap the top with parafilm to maintain sterility. **Shouldn't be done more than 24 hours in advance of sampling**.
3. Once the CTD is on deck, take bleached 1 L Nalgene bottles and dispense ~250 ml of sample water from the Niskin into the bottle; close the lid and shake vigorously. Dump. This will rid the container of residual bleach. Repeat process 2x (= three rinses in total). Water must come from the same Niskin that will be the source of the actual sample; otherwise, there will be cross-contamination.

**Tubing and adapter Sterilization:**

Barbed Tubing Adapter Sterilization:

Required to attach the peristaltic tubing to the clear tubing. This step can also be used for cleaning the pre-filter adapters if necessary.

1. Place barbed adapters in a clean 50 mL Falcon tube and fill with 10% bleach. 
2. Allow adapters to sit in bleach for 10 mins, shaking several times throughout.
3. Rinse 3x with RO water while shaking if available. If no RO is available, rinse individual adapters in sample water from the Niskin or bottle 3x immediately before sampling.

Tube Sterilization Method (RO Available):
1. Prepare a 10% bleach solution in one of the buckets (6-10 L total, depending on needs). Then, grab two sterile buckets and fill one with RO water (6-10 L total, depending on needs). Leave the other sterile bucket for peristaltic tubing storage post-sterilization.
2. Soak the peristaltic and clear tubing in the bucket with bleach for 15 min; make sure the bleach makes it into the inside of the tube. The best way to ensure the tube is filled is by rolling up the tube and then making sure both openings are submerged. Air bubbles should escape as the tube fills.
5. Before transferring to the RO bucket, make sure to run bleach again through the tubing before transferring to RO.
6. Soak the tubing in the bucket with RO for 15 min; make sure the bleach makes it into the inside of the tube.
7. Before transferring sterile tubing to a sterile storage bucket, make sure to run RO water again through the tube.

Tube Sterilization Method (RO Not Available):
1. Complete Steps 1-2 from Tube Sterilization Method (RO Available), minus the bucket filled with RO water.
2. Soak the peristaltic and clear tubing in the bucket with bleach for 15 min; make sure the bleach makes it into the inside of the tube. The best way to ensure the tube is filled is by rolling up the tube and then making sure both openings are submerged. Air bubbles should escape as the tube fills.
3. Remove tubing from bleach bucket and wipe down ends with kimwipe and 70% EtOH. Place in sterile storage bucket. **Shouldn't be done more than 24 hours in advance of sampling to avoid tube damage due to bleach residue**
4. Once the CTD is on deck, with a sterilized Nalgene bottle, collect ~250 ml of Niskin sample water in addition to the 1 L Nalgene bottle sample. Before filtering through the sterivex, run the 250 ml of sample water through the tubing to clean off residual bleach. Use tubing immediately.

**Bench Space Preparation:**
* Anchor the peristaltic pump and carboy to ship bench using screws/eye bolts or bungee cords.
* Sterilize the workstation by wiping surfaces with kimwipes and a 10% bleach solution before every sampling event. If the workspace surface is wood, use the tabletop covering to cover the sample processing area.
* Optional but encouraged: store items that can easily tip/fall in rough seas in an anchored container such as a tupperware or crate to prevent falling and contamination.

**Immediately Before Sampling:**
* All sterile fittings should be left in the packaging until ready to use. 
* Organize your peristaltic and clear tubing, water catchment bucket (if no sink is available), and Smith-Root filters for all samples at a station prior to collection. 
* Pre-label Smith-Root bags with sample number and with the cast number, location, date, etc.
* Make a small boat of folded aluminum foil on which to rest your clean tubing if needed (if re-using the same tubing for multiple samples).

**Field Notebook:**

When eDNA sampling in the field, there should be a corresponding field notebook. On larger cruises where CTD logs are kept after each cast, record the sample # in the logs in the corresponding Niskin row. Then, in the field notebook, record the date, sample #, depth, and cast # in the field notebook. Any other associated notes should also be recorded here, such as filtering issues, time before filtering (if longer than ~1 hour), etc. 

On smaller cruises where no CTD logs are kept or water is sampled without a CTD, more detail is required in the field note. Record the date, sample #, site name, lat/long, cast #, depth, and any other associated notes (e.g., filtering issues, sampling device, cast deployment time).

### Sampling
This protocol is designed for samples collected with a Niskin bottle - the samples are expected to be discrete and sealed masses of water that can be transferred to a 1 L Nalgene bottle without contamination (typically from the spout/spigot of the Niskin bottle). For our samples, Niskin bottles are remotely triggered to close at a specified depth and collected alongside complementary hydrographic data (using a CTD attached to the Niskin sampling rosette). 

Fill a 1 L Nalgene bottle with 1 L of sample water. It is important to do this before the sample water has sat on the deck in the sun. After collecting, if you don’t have time to filter, label, and store bottles in the fridge (4˚C) for up to 12 hours (>4 hours is not ideal). Note the length of time a water sample sits in the fridge in the field notebook.

### Filtration

This protocol is designed for samples collected with a Smith-Root filter directly from a body of water or 1L bottle of sample water. Sample water is drawn through the “straw” + filter cartridge via clear tubing attached to the outlet (yellow) side and run through the peristaltic pump. The straw is attached to the Smith-Root filter inlet (rubbery white end) and then submerged in the sample water. The filter housing itself should not be submerged. Sample water is then pumped through the filter. With this method, the same tubing can be used for all samples taken from a single site (i.e. at different depths) but should not be re-used between sites without sterilization. 


**Note: The standard protocol is for filtering directly from a 1L Nalgene bottle. This protocol can be used to filter from a clean bucket or bin. If filtering inline from a carboy or Niskin bottle directly, the eDNA Pre-Filter Adapter will need to be purchased from Smith-Root to adapt from the Smith-Root inlet to 1/4" inner diameter tubing.**

1. Remove a sterile peristaltic tube from the sterile bucket and insert it into the slot in the  pump. Place one end in a bucket/sink/other catchment, and insert a barbed adapter into the other end. During this process, keep the tubing on the adapter side off the counter to avoid contamination (i.e., use an aluminum foil boat). 
2. Remove a clear tube from the sterile bucket and attach to the barbed adapter, taking care to keep the clean end of the tubing sterile.
3. Remove a Smith-Root filter and inlet prefilter straw (included in bag) from the packaging - avoid touching the inlet or outlet and keep the straw clean. Attach Smith-Root to sterile clear tubing via the barbed end of the Smith-Root outlet (yellow) filter housing. Save the packaging bag as you will place the Smith-Root filter back into it after sampling for storage.
4. Attach the prefilter straw to the inlet (white) end of the Smith-Root filter housing. If you are running the filter inline, you will attach the pre-filter adapter and tubing here instead.
5. Stick the inlet end of the Smith-Root straw into the sample water in the Nalgene bottle - do not submerge the Smith-Root entirely. If the junction between the two halves of the Smith-Root is submerged, the sample can get sucked into the tubing, bypass the filter, and as a result, contaminate the tubing and reduce the sample volume passed through the filter. Submerging the yellow desiccant end of the filter housing can also reduce its preservational capacity and compromise the sample.
6. Outflow can be directed to the sink or bucket. Start the pump at 35 rpm and adjust upwards accordingly up to ~80 rpm so that the sample takes 7-10 minutes for a sample with low turbidity.
7. Once all is filtered, continue pumping until all water is removed from the Smith-Root, then run dry for 1 minute to pre-dry the sample prior to preservation. Remove the straw from the inlet end of the Smith-Root and discard. 
8. Remove the Smith-Root filter housing from the tubing and immediately place back in the provided labeled bag and seal carefully. Place the section of tubing with the barbed luer adapter in your clean aluminum foil boat for reuse with a replicate sample or another sample from the same site.


### Sample Preservation

The Smith-Root filter housing contains a proprietary desiccant (the yellow end of the housing) that dries and preserves the sample without the need for additonal preservatives. Ensure the Smith-Root bag is well sealed so no additional air can get in, and that the filter housing is entirely empty of water. There is no need to remove the disc filter from the Smith-Root for separate preservation as the housing and bag are designed to preserve the sample.

### Storage

Store preserved samples at room temperature in a dry, cool location. Samples can be shipped without any need for cooling, provided that shipping temperatures are not excessively hot or below freezing.

Samples should be extracted as soon as is timely and sterile (not onboard a ship), but the Smith-Root has been demonstrated to preserve DNA for at least 6 months if needed.

### Quality Control

A field blank consisting of sterile RO water in a pre-filled and sealed (prior to fieldwork) 1 L bottle is filtered at the start and end of a cruise using a new sterile peristaltic tube and fittings. If more than 50 samples are collected on a cruise, an additional field blank is filtered every 50 samples. 

### Basic Troubleshooting Guide

**Issue 1:** Clogged filter.

**Solution:** If a Smith-Root filter clogs prior to filtering 1 L (water no longer passes through), then denote the volume filtered and continue filtering through a new Smith-Root filter. Repeat until 1 L is filtered. Mark each additional Smith-Root, record additional sample names and notes, and denote volumes filtered for each in the field notebook.
